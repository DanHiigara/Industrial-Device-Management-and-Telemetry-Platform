      # NOTE:
      # If you previously added a "dependency snapshot" / "dependency submission" action and it fails with:
      #   "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')"
      # Remove that step, or re-add it only after the build is stable.
      #
      # The standard GitHub "dependency graph" still works without this step.
